## 💼 Work Experience

### AI Engineer | Backend Developer — MekongAI  
*June 2023 – Present*

- **Develop & Deploy AI Solutions**  
  - Implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture for chatbot systems, achieving a 15–20% improvement in retrieval accuracy and reducing average response time to under 2 seconds.  
  - Built Agentic Systems pipelines (Tool Calling, MCP) to automate over 8 complex business processes, saving 5–7 working hours per week for each team member.  
  - Researched and optimized Model Context Protocol (MCP) flows, accelerating AI decision-making by ~20% in testing scenarios.  
  - Refined Prompt Engineering workflows, increasing LLM problem-solving success rate by 20% and ensuring consistent content generation.

- **Train & Optimize AI Models**  
  - Performed fine-tuning of large language models on domain-specific datasets to adapt to context-sensitive tasks.  
  - Trained LoRA models (via AI-Toolkit, Flux) on image datasets for high-fidelity product image generation and refinement, reducing manual image creation time by 30%.

- **Backend Development & Database Management**  
  - Designed and implemented high-performance RESTful API endpoints using FastAPI, maintaining average latencies below 200ms and supporting 800 requests/minute to serve AI backends and frontend applications.  
  - Deployed and optimized Vector Databases (Qdrant) for efficient storage and querying of vector embeddings.  
  - Utilized Neo4j Graph Database to build knowledge graphs underpinning key AI projects.  
  - Managed SQL (MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases, enforcing data integrity and stable query performance for mission-critical applications.

- **AI Image Processing (ComfyUI)**  
  - Built and maintained 20+ complex image processing workflows—including Image Generation, FaceSwap, OutfitSwap, Background Removal, DeepFake, Virtual Try-On (VTO), and image restoration—processing 300–400 images/day to satisfy project requirements.  
  - Developed WebSocket APIs to connect ComfyUI workflows with frontend clients, enabling real-time image processing and result delivery.

- **Infrastructure Management & Automation**  
  - Administered VPS instances (Ubuntu, Linux) to deploy local LLMs for training and inference tasks.  
  - Automated 5+ repetitive workflows (e.g., RAG pipelines, integrations with Google Calendar/Drive, Zalo, Discord, Telegram, data ingestion) using N8N, reducing manual overhead and improving reliability.  
  - Managed hosting, DNS, and CDN (Hostinger, Cloudflare) to create subdomains, accelerate page load times, and enhance security for web applications.
